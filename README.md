# refactoring-pipeline-in-javascript

Algorithm on refactoring pipeline method from recursive function to ES6 spread operators and Array.prototype.reduce

Commented initial changes in index.js

** OLD is was written before
** NEW is changed version

ADDITIONAL: Also can sugest using 
a. CommonJS module system and import functions from another file
b. Unit Testing from another file

but both I think are offtopic of this task so project is realised without that features
Can integrate if needed
